A function in algebra is a rule that links each input (x) to exactly one output (y).
We often write a function as f(x), which means "f of x."
For example, if f(x) = 2x + 3, then when x = 2, the output is f(2) = 7.
Functions can be shown in different ways: as equations, tables, graphs, or word problems.
The domain of a function is all the possible input values (x).
The range is all the possible output values (y).
On a graph, functions usually appear as lines, curves, or other shapes.
A straight-line function is called a linear function, like f(x) = mx + b.
Other common types are quadratic functions (parabolas) and exponential functions (rapid growth/decay).
Functions are important because they describe patterns and relationships in math and real life.
