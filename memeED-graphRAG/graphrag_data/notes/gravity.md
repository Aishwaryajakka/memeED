Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other.
On Earth, it pulls everything toward the center of the planet, which is why things fall when dropped.
The strength of gravity depends on two things: the mass of the objects and the distance between them.
The bigger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull.
Thatâ€™s why Earth has stronger gravity than the Moon, and why we weigh less on the Moon.
Isaac Newton explained gravity as a force that acts at a distance, keeping planets in orbit around the Sun.
Later, Albert Einstein described gravity as the bending of space and time caused by mass.
Gravity gives us weight and holds our atmosphere in place.
It also controls tides, orbits of planets, and motion of galaxies.
Without gravity, life as we know it would not exist.
