Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own food.
It happens in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll.
Plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen.
The overall equation is:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.
Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle.
In the light reactions, water is split to release oxygen and energy molecules (ATP and NADPH) are made.
In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide and energy molecules are used to make glucose.
This process is important because it provides food for plants and releases oxygen for all living things.
Without photosynthesis, life on Earth would not survive.
